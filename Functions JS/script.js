// Function basics: exercise
// In this exercise we're going to write our first functions. Introduction

// We're going to write a function that makes pizza (sadly, we're not going to actually make pizza).

// create a new JavaScript file
// first just check if you can run it with node
// to take a step in the pizza-making process print the step to the console
// think of a good clear name for your function first
// think of at least three steps you need in your function
// write the function
// run the code, are you getting the result you expect? Why (not)?
// now add code to call your function
// now call your function three times
// Now we have a single function, but let's make another function! We also want to make sushi.

// continue in the same JavaScript file
// add a function that makes sushi, use a good name
// call this function, check that it works
// So now, let's for a minute pretend that we work in a restaurant and we get an order for three meals of sushi and two pizzas.

// change your code so that the output of your program is the steps for making sushi, three times and pizza two times
